## :scroll: Description
This is app that is build for #AndroidDevChallenge Week #4. It is a weather application, but to make
things more interesting I built the application that reports weather on Mars! I uses data from NASA's
InSight Mars lander. The lander is located near the equator at location named - Elysium Planitia, which.
The data is available through the InSight: 
[Mars Weather Service API](https://api.nasa.gov/assets/insight/InSight%20Weather%20API%20Documentation.pdf)

Unfortunately though currently the landers solar pannels are covered with dust and it is
placed in power conservation mode and not all data is available.
Currently only atmospheric pressure data is available. Hopefully all data will be available soon enough!
